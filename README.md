## Mapping

This was originally created to try and create a **2D Raycasting** simulation through pygame, and I very much so plan on coming back and implementing it!

For now, it simply takes a matrix array of 1's and \_'s and smartly creates a map through list comprehension.

## Files
`main.py` - Runs the game object\
`map.py` - Create and initializes the map\
`player.py` - Will eventually be a player object implementation\
`settings.py` - Holds any constants including aspect ratio, fps, and eventually more.
